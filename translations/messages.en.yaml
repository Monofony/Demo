        about_demo_content: |
            This website is a demo of the Monofony project.
            Monofony is a micro-framework created by Loïc Frémont.
            It uses Sylius packages to build a powerful admin panel.
            It also contains some basic features like registering, login, resetting password.
            There are two extra packages to build your API and the public views of your application.
            This demo uses all the Monofony packages.
